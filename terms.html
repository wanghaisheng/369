    "title": "My Manifestation Journey",
    "subtitle": "How the 369 method helped me overcome 38 years of self-blame and inspired me to help others",
    "founderName": "From the Founder",
    "intro": "For 38 years, I carried the weight of self-blame on my shoulders. Every setback, every failure, every missed opportunity became another brick in the wall I built around myself. I was my own harshest critic, and this constant self-judgment left me feeling stuck, worthless, and powerless to change my circumstances.",
    "discovery": "The Turning Point: Discovering Manifestation",
    "discoveryText": "My turning point came when I discovered manifestation techniques, particularly the 369 method. At first, I was skeptical. How could simply writing affirmations change my deeply ingrained patterns of self-blame? But I was desperate for change, so I committed to trying it consistently for 45 days.",
    "discoveryText2": "The affirmation I chose was simple: \"I am worthy of love and forgiveness, especially from myself.\" Three times in the morning, six times in the afternoon, and nine times before bed – I wrote these words faithfully, even on days when I didn't believe them.",
    "transformation": "The Transformation",
    "transformationText": "The change wasn't immediate, but it was profound. Around day 21, I noticed my internal dialogue beginning to shift. The voice of self-blame grew quieter, while a new voice – one of compassion and understanding – grew stronger. By day 45, I had experienced a fundamental shift in how I related to myself.",
    "transformationText2": "This wasn't just positive thinking – it was a rewiring of deeply held beliefs. The 369 method had helped me create new neural pathways, ones that led to self-acceptance rather than self-destruction. For the first time in 38 years, I felt free from the prison of self-blame.",
    "mission": "The Mission: Creating HeyManifestation.com",
    "missionText": "My personal transformation sparked a mission: to make manifestation techniques accessible to everyone struggling with similar challenges. I founded HeyManifestation.com with a bold vision – to create 50 different manifestation apps, each addressing specific areas of life where people feel stuck or limited.",
    "missionText2": "The 369 Manifestation Method app is the first of these 50 planned applications. I designed it to provide structure, accountability, and guidance – everything I wish I'd had when starting my own journey. The app combines ancient wisdom with modern technology to make manifestation practice simple, effective, and accessible.",
    "invitation": "My Invitation to You",
    "invitationText": "If you're carrying the weight of self-blame, limiting beliefs, or any other mental barriers that keep you from living your fullest life, I invite you to try the 369 method. Whether you use our app or simply a pen and paper, the consistent practice of rewriting your mental narrative can create profound change.",
    "invitationText2": "And as I work toward my goal of creating 50 manifestation apps, I welcome your feedback, suggestions, and stories. Together, we can build tools that help more people break free from self-imposed limitations and step into their full potential.",
